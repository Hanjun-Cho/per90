After the mediocre performance in the 2-2 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, it's noticeably clear the team needs a creative midfielder to relieve ourselves of opposition high press. 
The heavy reliance on Kane to create by dropping deep clearly didn't work very well against them and that's more reason for Conte and Paratici to look to incoming transfers as a solution to 
the creative midfielder problem. <br><br>

Rumors of a Christian Eriksen return - <a class="text-blue font-bold" href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/transfer-news-man-utd-complete-signing-of-christian-eriksen">prior to his move to Manchester United</a> - Nicolo Zaniolo, and James Maddison were quick to pop up, but all were equally quick to return to the rumor archives. 
The most recent rumor to add onto the list is Ruslan Malinovskyi, a 29-year-old Ukrainian attacking midfielder currently playing for Atalanta in Serie A. <br><br>

The Ukrainian International, currently with 49 caps, was unfortunately part of the Atalanta side that missed out on Europe this season. <a class="text-blue font-bold" href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/ruslan-malinovskyi/profil/spieler/207877">With 1 year left on his contract</a>, there's a good chance Malinovskyi 
will be allowed to leave on a lower fee. <br><br>

An attacking midfielder and central midfielder, Malinovskyi has contributed 29 goals and 26 assists since joining Atalanta from Genk in 2019. In last season alone, he contributed 10 goals and 7 assists 
in 41 games averaging 0.76 goal contributions per 90 - 0.4 goals per 90 and 0.36 assists per 90. <br><br>

His involvement in Atalanta's attack is clear as he currently ranks in the top 3 percent for passes into penalty area at 2.66 passes per 90 and top 5 percent for progressive passes at 5.79 passes per 90 
- edging out Hojbjerg who boasts 1.04 passes into penalty area per 90 and 5.72 progressive passes per 90. The Atalanta midfielder easily beats any of our current midfield options in-possession as he 
possesses 7.48 progressive carries and 2.57 carries into the final third per 90, which while not as impressive on the percentile scale, is still much more than Bissouma, Hojbjerg, and Bentancur. <br><br>

The biggest downside to Malinovskyi' s game is easily his defending. With a mere 73% pass completion rate, he could present the opposition with the ball when trying to attempt a risky pass. 
With only 0.52 interceptions and 0.76 tackles won per 90, he sits at the bottom 9 percent and 35 percent among all attacking midfielders of the top 5 leagues. <br><br>

However, stats aren't able to show the big picture, how does Malinovskyi actually fit into Conte's 3421? <br><br>

The former Genk midfielder has shown a tendency to drift wide and cut in from the flanks which could see him operating on the sides as an inverted winger. If not out wide, Malinovskyi could play as 
part of the 2-man pivot with his midfield duo being someone with a heavy defensive mindset to ensure Malinovskyi's defensive caveats are considered. <br><br>

<a class="text-blue font-bold" href="https://tbrfootball.com/report-malinovskyi-has-agreed-to-join-tottenham-fee-being-discussed/">For a reported fee of 16.9m</a>, Malinovskyi would be a bargain option to boost our creative output in midfield. His lackluster defensive game would definitely be a concern, 
but on the other hand, his creativity is exactly what Spurs would need to try and relieve themselves of opposition high press. <br>
